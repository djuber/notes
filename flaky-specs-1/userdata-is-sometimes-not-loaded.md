# userData is sometimes not loaded

Noticed this after [https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/12862/](https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/12862/files) was merged - and developers started reporting failures that they were sometimes able to replicate in isolation, sometimes not. Julianna was able to work around the failures she was seeing by adding a second page load in [https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/13224](https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/13224)

The rest of this page is describing how we got from failing test to "fixed" test, and what the next steps are - this will probably get distilled into a forem github issue after I get my thoughts together here.



Actual problem is that a non-trusted user \(who should not show the Flag option in another user's profile page\) is in fact showing that the first time they visit the page.

Internal forem team slack link [https://forem-team.slack.com/archives/C012YSX5ZC1/p1617289014004500](https://forem-team.slack.com/archives/C012YSX5ZC1/p1617289014004500) - but I'll distill what was useful from this discussion here since it's important background.

> Seeing a handful of failures related to `trsuted_user_flags_user_spec.rb` , specifically line 16: `when signed in as a non-trusted user, it does not show the flag button` . When I run the entire spec, the tests pass without an issue, but when I run just the specified test on its own, it fails with the same failures Iâ€™m seeing on Travis \(failure in thread\)
